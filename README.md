# Neumorphism

This is the week 1 assignment for the ITP class Dynamic Web Development.

## Up and Running

Following the tutorial, I generated the SSH Key and applied to Github.

Then started the project with a README file via terminal.

## Start HTML coding

I installed the `Install code command in PATH1` following [Visual Studio Code on macOS guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac), then launched visual studio from the terminal. Within VS Code's terminal, I `touch index.html` to start a blank index file. And also generated the boilerplate with the `!` keyword.

## Inspiration

There are people saying Neumorphism aka Soft UI will become one of the UI trends in 2020, and I particularly appreciate the visual that defy the standard material design that has been popular for quite a while. Interestingly, I find the style to be reminiscent of how art pieces being exhibited in a gallery.
