This is the week 1 assignment for the ITP class Dynamic Web Development.

## Up and Running

Following the tutorial, I generated the SSH Key and applied to Github.

Then started the project with a README file via terminal.

## Start HTML coding

I installed the `Install code command in PATH1` following [Visual Studio Code on macOS guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac), then launched visual studio from the terminal. Within VS Code's terminal, I `touch index.html` to start a blank index file. And also generated the boilerplate with the `!` keyword.
